# Contributing to Frame Batteries

Thank you for considering contributing to Frame Batteries! 

We use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for structuring our code. For an introduction to DDD in Python, we recommend reading the [Cosmic Python book](https://www.cosmicpython.com/book/preface.html). Ensure all code includes strict type hints and is well-tested using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

When submitting a pull request, please include a clear rationale for the changes, a detailed description of the solution, *test cases* and any alternatives considered.

Follow this structure: what problem is being solved, why this solution was chosen, and what other solutions were considered. This helps us understand your thought process and review your PR effectively.

We expect all contributors to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Thank you for your contributions, and we look forward to your pull requests. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or reach out to a maintainer.
